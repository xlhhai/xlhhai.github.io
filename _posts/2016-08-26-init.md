Although I have already had an English blog:[my English blog](http://en.xulihang.me), I decided to have a new English blog on github. Because I can do my editing on my local computer. My old computer only has a 933Mhz CPU. It's difficult to load webpages. I seldom use my previous English blog, so I think this new blog will help me write more articles in English.
