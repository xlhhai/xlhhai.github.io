最令人怵目惊心的一件事，是看着钟表上的秒针一下一下的移动，每移动一下就是表示我们的寿命已经缩短了一部分。

What is the most startling is that when we look at a clock ticking, we get to know every tick <del>means</del> **indicates** that a second of our lifetime has elapsed.

再看着墙上挂着的可以一张张撕下的日历，每天撕下一张就是表示我们的寿命又缩短了一天。

**Likewise,** the calendar hanging on the wall is torn off page by page, which <del>means</del> **indicates** that a day of our lifetime has elapsed.

因为时间即是生命。

<del>Because</del> **Therefore,** time is life.

没有人不爱惜他的生命，但很少有人珍视他的时间。

No one does not cherish his life, but few people value his time.

如果想在有生之年做一点什么事，学一点什么学问，充实自己，帮助别人，使生命成为有意义，不虚此生，那么就不可浪费光阴。

If you want to achieve something, learn something, fill yourself with knowledge, help others and make life meaningful and worthy when you are alive, then you should not waste time.

这道理人人都懂，可很少人真能积极不懈的善于利用他的时间。

This rule, everybody knows. But few manage to make full use of <del>his</del> **their** time.

我自己是浪费了很多时间的一个人。

I am such a person who has wasted a lot of time.

我不打麻将，我也不经常地听戏看电影，几年中难得一次，我不长时间的看电视，通常只看半个小时，我也不串门子闲聊天。

I don't play mahjong and rarely watch an opera or see a movie, perhaps once in several years. I don't watch TV for a long time, usually just about half an hour. I don't visit my neighbors and chat with them, either.

有人问我："那么你大部分时间都做了些什么呢？”我痛自反省，我发现，除了职务上的必须及人情上所不能免的活动之外，我的时间大部分都浪费了。

I was asked what I did **with** most of the time. I started to reflect and found out that most of my time was wasted except some spent on necessary activities for work and human relations.

我应该集中精力，读我所未读过的书，我应该利用所有时间，写我所要写的东西。

I should focus myself on reading the books I have never read and spend every minute in writing what I am supposed to write.

但是我没能这样做，我的好多时间都稀里糊涂的混过去了，“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲。”

But I did not do so. Most of my time has been wasted unconsciously. "A lazy youth, a lousy age."

例如我翻译莎士比亚，本来计划于课余之暇每年翻译两部，二十年即可完成，但是我用了三十年，主要的原因是懒。

One example is my translation of Shakespeare. I planned to translate two of them a year in my spare time and it can be done in 20 years. But I used 30 years, mainly because of laziness.

翻译之所以完成，主要是因为活得相当长久，十分惊险。

The reason why I can complete the translation is because I live **fairly** long. It's very possible that I can not make it.

翻译完成之后，虽然仍有工作计划，但体力渐衰，有力不从心之感，假使年轻的时候鞭策自己，如今当有较好或较多的表现。

After the translation is done, I still have work plans. But as my energy has decreased, I feel difficult to do these. If I had <del>regulated</del> **spurred** myself <del>well</del> when young, I should have had a better achievement.

然而悔之晚矣。

However, it's too late to regret.

再例如，作为一个中国人，经书不可不读，我年过三十才知道读书自修的重要。

Another example is that as a Chinese, we must read Chinese classics. I did not realize the importance of reading and self-learning until I was 30 years old.。

我披阅，我圈点，但是恒心不足，时做时辍。

I read and circle what I think is important. But I lack the perseverance to keep doing.

五十以学易，可以无大过矣，我如今年过八十，还没有接触过易经，说来惭愧。

If one starts to learn Yijing, which is The Book of Changes, he can have no big mistake. But I have not read it <del>and</del> though I am over 80 this year. It's ashamed.

史书也很重要，我出国留学的时候，我父亲买了一套同文石印的前四史，塞满了我的行箧的一半空间，我在国外混了几年之后又把前四史原封带回来了。

History books are also important. When I went to study abroad, my father bought me a set of history books, which are the first four of the 24 Chinese history books. The books are lithographically printed by Tongwen Publishing house. They filled half of my luggage while **several years later,** I just took them back <del>after several years abroad</del> without reading them. 

直到四十年后才鼓起勇气读了“通鉴”一遍。

It was **not** until 40 years later did I have the courage to go through one history book---History as a Mirror.

现在我要读的书太多了，深感时间有限。

Now I have to read too many books and I feel deeply that time is limited.

无论做什么事，健康的身体是基本条件。

Whatever you do, it is fundamental to be healthy.

我在学校读书的时候，有所谓的“强迫运动”，我踢破过几双球鞋，打断过几只球拍。

During my school time, there was so-called "compulsory exercise". I wore out several pairs of sneakers and broke several rackets.

因此侥幸维持下来最低限度的体力。

Therefore I have the minimum physical strength required.

老来打过几年太极拳，目前则是以散步活动筋骨而已。

I played Tai-chi for several years when I became old. Now, I just walk to exercise my body.

寄语年轻朋友，千万要持之以恒的从事运动，这不是嬉戏，不是浪费时间。

To young friends: Keep exercising. It's not just about fun and is not wasting time.

健康的身体是作人做事的真正的本钱。

A healthy body is the foundation of <del>working</del> **a successful life and career**.
